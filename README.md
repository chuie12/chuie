**Whobechuie**

I am currently a student at UNO in the applied computing program. I got interested in IT after my last gig as an implementation analyst for Fiserv. The devops cycle was pretty manageable and I saw that more money was available on the IT side of things, so I quit and decided to get my tech credentials to make the jump. Prior to working at Fiserv, I was in the Air Force for about 10 years where I worked as a Chinese Mandarin language analyst. The military offered to pay for my education, so I was able to get my first bachelor's and an MBA prior to ~~escaping~~ separating from the service. I spend most of my free time with my wife and two kids, the kids take a lot of it as they are a fresh 5 and 7. I also like to play video games when I get the chance.

Fun fact: I work at a pizzeria. The place is called Mootz and their pizza dough is excellent.

**Workstyle**

I can work in nearly any environment or condition for periods of time that would be considered inhuman to some. Most of my Air Force career was spent jammed into a flying metal tube for "intercontinental travel" amounts of time on a near daily basis. Checklists have an important place in my life and if there is not one in existence prior to me starting a process there will be one on that process when I am done. That being said, I am normally pretty "chill" in nature and can remain flexible in most situations. I prefer to work on my own, but do enjoy teamwork when the situation calls for it.

**Feedback**

I can take criticism, but it better be constructive otherwise some will come back your way.

**Strengths and Weaknesses**

Strengths - I am very determined when I have a goal to accomplish and am very good at working in ambiguity.

Weaknesses - I prefer to work alone, which has led to instances where things have proceeded slower than they otherwise could have.

I have experience in the following areas:

- Project Management
- Risk Assessment/Management
- Instruction/Evaluation
- "Figuring it out"
